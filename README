ABOUT MWBGRADER
===============
mwbgrader is a program to assign a grade to a submitted .mwb
MySQL Workbench file. There are two main operating modes:
* Grading a .mwb on its own.
  The program looks for common mistakes and takes points off
  when something that has strong odds of being a design mistake is
  encountered.
* Comparing a .mwb to a "correct design"
  In that case, a "distance" is measured between the submission and
  the "correct design" (note that several acceptable designs can 
  be provided by the instructor; the submission is compared to the 
  closest). This "distance" is used to compute a part of the grade.
  The other part of the grade is computed as when the .mwb file is
  graded on its own, with the difference that if the "correct design"
  doesn't pass a test, the test isn't applied to the submission.

Note that grading is optional, and the tool (which can provide with the
-r flag a report on the checks if performs) can also be used to provide
feedback about possible weaknesses in the database model at the start
of a project.
A default, and reasonable for the author, grading scheme is coded in the tool
but can be completely overridden, which can be useful for adjusting to
the level of the authors of the design being appraised.
